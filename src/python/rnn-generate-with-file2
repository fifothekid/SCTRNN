$program  - a program to display output of recurrent neural networks by means of sequence data as input.

Usage: $program [-s seed] [-i indices] [-w window_length] [-n reg_count] [-l rho_init] [-m momentum] [-c] [-a] rnn-file sequence-file
Usage: $program [-v] [-h]

Available options are:
-s seed
    \`seed' is the seed for the initialization of random number generator, which specifies a starting point for the random number sequence, and provides for restarting at the same point. If this option is omitted, the current system time is used.
-i indices
    \`indices' is the indices to ignore data in sequence-file. the indices are separated by a comma (ex: -i 0,2).
-w window_length
    Window length for BPTT. Default is $window_length.
-n reg_count
    Number of the training iterations of BPTT for each step. Default is $reg_count.
-l rho_init
    Learning rate for BPTT. Default is $rho_init.
-m momentum
    Learning momentum for BPTT. Default is $moment.
-c
    Displays context states instead of output.
-a
    Displays output and context states.
-v
    Prints the version information and exit.
-h
    Prints this help and exit.

Program execution:
First, $program reads the rnn-file (ex: rnn.dat) generated by rnn-learn in order to setup model parameters. Next, it displays output of a network by means of an input sequence described in sequence-file.
